"""
Utility helpers for the Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing project.

This package is intended for small, reusable helpers that don't naturally
belong in `geometry`, `evaluation`, or `packers`, for example:

- Timing / profiling helpers
- Logging wrappers
- Small math helpers
- CSV / path utilities used in notebooks and scripts

Keeping them here avoids cluttering the main modules and keeps imports tidy.
