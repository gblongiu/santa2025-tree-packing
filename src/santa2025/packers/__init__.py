"""
Packing strategies for the Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing project.

This package is intended to contain multiple packing algorithms, for example:

- Hexagonal lattice baseline (`hex_lattice.py`)
- Local search refinements (`local_search.py`)
- Alternative / experimental patterns (`radial_baseline.py`, `patterns.py`, ...)

High-level code (e.g. `santa2025.submission`) should depend on *interfaces*
here rather than on notebooks, so we can iterate freely on implementations.
